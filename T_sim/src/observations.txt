differences between spring_rod and spring_rod2

1. spring_rod2 is much slower, this is likely because the main loop we simulate in is in python scope rather than taichi scope

 --> Possible solutions?
 Issue with doing it all in taichi scope is they don't allow nested kernels and they also don't like too many nested for-loops
  - struct for is something like:
    for i in field
 These are parallelized vs. for i in range(...) these are serialized

2. Different values -> is there an error in my computations or is there some difference in physical quantities?

For each rigid body shape:
 - should be able to internally calculate I_body and I_body_inv (look at Nelson's simulator utils/intertia_tensors)
 - Look at how Nelson handles json, for most objects want to compute quaternion via sites/endpoints
    - Look at utils/torch_quaternion.py and the function compute_quat_btwn_z_and_vec (principal axis = normalized endpt diff)
 - Once verify spring_rod == mujoco, check with damping=10, then have non-symmetric springs (check rotation based on endpoints)


 Verified stiffness with symmetric springs
 Verified stiffness + damping with symmetric springs
 NOT the same with non-symmetric springs (mujoco quaternion seems to have magnitude greater than 1?)
  -> Seems like the z pos is the same but not the x position (should I print diff of spring forces?)

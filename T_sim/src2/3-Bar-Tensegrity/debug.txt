Observations:
1st timestep: 
 - Currently they match

2nd timestep:
 - Different accelerations => incorrect force computation
 - Different tendon lengths -> Different site positions -> MEANS THERE MUST BE A PROBLEM IN UPDATE SITES


Trying with 0 damping to see if this is a site velocity issue:
 - Still different accelerations => Site velocity is not the issue (or the full issue)
